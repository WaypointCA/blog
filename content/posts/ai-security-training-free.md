I spent three months building a comprehensive AI security training program. Instead of selling it, I'm giving it away.

## Why I Built This

The AI security field is moving faster than most training programs can keep up with. I watched colleagues struggle to find coherent learning paths that didn't cost thousands of dollars or require a PhD in machine learning.

So I built what I wish existed when I started: a structured 36-week program that takes you from traditional security professional to AI security specialist.

## What's Inside

The learning path covers four phases:

**Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-8)**
Python for security professionals, ML/AI fundamentals, and setting up your lab environment. You'll build the technical foundation needed for everything that follows.

**Phase 2: AI Security Fundamentals (Weeks 9-18)**
LLM architecture, prompt injection attacks, model security, and adversarial machine learning. This is where you start thinking like an AI red teamer.

**Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Weeks 19-30)**
Supply chain security for ML, AI governance frameworks, building secure AI pipelines, and advanced attack techniques.

**Phase 4: Specialization (Weeks 31-36)**
Choose your path: AI Red Team, AI Blue Team, or AI Governance. Each track has specific projects and resources.

## Who This Is For

You need existing security experience. If you can explain how a SQL injection works, you're ready.

It's designed for:
- Security professionals expanding into AI/ML
- Penetration testers adding LLM red teaming
- Blue teamers building AI defenses
- Developers wanting to secure their AI implementations

If you're brand new to security, start elsewhere first. This builds on existing knowledge.

## The Time Investment

I won't pretend this is easy. The path is structured for:
- 2-3 hours daily (weekdays)
- 4-6 hours on weekends
- 36 weeks total

You can accelerate if you already have ML background. You can slow down if you need to. The checkboxes in the repository let you track your progress at whatever pace works for you.

## Get Started

The complete learning path, setup scripts, and lab structure are available here:

**[github.com/WaypointCA/ai-security-lab](https://github.com/WaypointCA/ai-security-lab)**

Clone it. Fork it. Make it your own. Check off the boxes as you go.

If you find broken links or have resources to add, contributions are welcome. This is a living document that should grow with the community.

## A Request

If this helps you, I have one ask: **pay it forward.**

Share it with someone else who's trying to break into AI security. Write about what you learn. Contribute tools back to the open-source projects that made your learning possible.

The AI security community is small enough that we all know each other, and generous enough that we all help each other. That's how we got here, and that's how we move forward.
