I put together a 36-week AI security learning path and figured others might find it useful.

<!--more-->

## What It Is

It's a structured curriculum that takes someone with security experience through the fundamentals of AI/ML security. Python basics, how LLMs actually work, prompt injection, adversarial ML, supply chain concerns - that kind of thing.

The repo has checkboxes so you can track progress. There are setup scripts for building a home lab. Nothing fancy, just organized.

## Who It's For

You need to already understand security concepts. If you know what SQL injection is and why input validation matters, you'll be fine. If you're brand new to security, this probably isn't the right starting point.

## Time Commitment

I structured it for about 2-3 hours on weekdays and more on weekends. 36 weeks total. You can go faster or slower depending on your background and schedule.

## The Repo

**[github.com/WaypointCA/ai-security-lab](https://github.com/WaypointCA/ai-security-lab)**

Fork it, use it however works for you. If you find broken links or want to add resources, PRs are welcome.

## Why Give It Away

When I was coming up in this field, other people shared their knowledge freely. That's how most of us learned. Seems right to do the same.

If it helps you, great. If you end up contributing back to the community in some way - writing about what you learn, helping someone else, contributing to open source projects - even better.
